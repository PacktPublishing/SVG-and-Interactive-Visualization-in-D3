## About the Video Course
D3.js is a JavaScript library designed to display digital data in dynamic graphical form. It helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3 allows greater control over the final visual result, and it is the hottest and most powerful web-based data visualization technology on the market today. In this course, you will learn how to map values in your data domain to the visual domain using scales, and use the various shape functions supported by D3 to create SVG shapes in visualizations. Moving on, youâ€™ll see how to use and customize various D3 axes and master transition to add bells and whistles to otherwise dry visualizations.
